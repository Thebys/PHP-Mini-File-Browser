# PHP-Mini-File-Browser
This is really simple&primitive and dangerous script allows you:
- iterate throw directory structure and show rights
- show basic info about PHP configuraion (version, extensions, disable functions, openbasedir, or complete phpinfo)
- download files from the server (if enabled)
- run system commands via various methods (if enabled)

The script will **delete itself after 1 hour** for security reasons (you can configure this behavior). It is also possible to set credentials to use this script, of course.
