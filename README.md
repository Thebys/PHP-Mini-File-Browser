# PHP-Mini-File-Browser

[My writeup about this tool](https://smitka.me/2024/04/12/php-mini-file-browser-update/)

This is really simple&primitive and dangerous script which allows you:
- iterate throw directory structure and show permissions, it uses 2 methods:
   - plain PHP which can be limited via open_basedir
   - shell_exec system function which can be limited by disabled_functions
- show basic info about PHP configuraion (version, extensions, disable functions, open_basedir, or complete phpinfo)
- download files from the server (if enabled)
- upload files from URL to the server (if enabled)
- read files and show their content (text, images, archives content)
- run system commands via various methods (if enabled)

The script will **delete itself after 1 hour** for security reasons (you can configure this behavior). It is also possible to set credentials to use this script, of course.

> [!CAUTION]
> Do not grant ‚ÄúMFB‚Äù access to untrusted users, as a skilled user could escalate their privileges and do anything to your site and server üòâ. The script is full of security threats and can cause FPD, XSS, SQLi, SSRF, LFI, RCE, WTF, etc.
